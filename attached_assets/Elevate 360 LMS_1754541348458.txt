
## 🔁 REFINEMENT STRATEGY

### 🧭 OVERALL DESIGN FRAME

**Phase 1** already includes 3 major user roles (Learner, Mentor, Admin) + Hybrid Deployment + a clean module hierarchy.

To make this **fully dual-purpose (academic + corporate)**, let’s refine it around:

* **Clearer role mapping**
* **Modular course styles (Academic vs. Corporate)**
* **Universal utilities** (e.g., dashboards, messaging, tagging)
* **Smart automation and analytics**
* **Future-proofing (scalability, compliance, integrations)**
