I want to add a new AI Assistant section called **Nura AI** to the existing Elevate360 LMS frontend.

The LMS already has 3 dashboards: Learner, Mentor, and Admin.

Please help me implement the **frontend UI components only** for Nura AI in each dashboard, using the following stack:

- Framework: React (or Vanilla JS if no framework used)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (or Replit-compatible CSS)
- Structure: Modular + responsive design

---

### 📚 Components to Implement:

1. **🔵 NuraAISection.js** (reusable component wrapper)
   - Reusable section layout with a title, subtitle, and dynamic content slot
   - Props: `title`, `description`, `children`

### 👨‍🎓 Learner Dashboard – Nura AI Section

Add a new section called “Nura AI” below the main content area. It should include:

- **Smart Study Planner**
  - Weekly calendar view with auto-generated tasks
  - Button: "Generate My Study Plan"
  - Table/List layout showing:
    - Course name
    - Recommended time block
    - Priority level (color coded)
- **Explain Like I’m New (ELIN)**
  - Input box: “What do you need help with?”
  - Button: “Ask Nura”
  - Output box that displays AI explanation
- **AI Course Recommendation**
  - Panel showing:
    - Suggested next course
    - Skill tags (e.g., #projectmanagement)
    - Explanation of why it was recommended

    - “Correct” / “Incorrect” label with icons
    - Explanation of answer
    - Suggested retry or “Review module” button

### 👩‍🏫 Mentor Dashboard – Nura AI Section

Add Nura AI section with:

- **Auto-Summarize Learner Progress**
  - Summary panel:
    - “5 learners are behind”
    - Drop-off module(s)
    - Suggested interventions
  - Color-coded list by group
- **Generate Learner Report (view-only)**
  - Dropdown to select learner
  - Display Learner Summary Card (skills, gaps, completion %)
- **Generate Course Report**
  - Select course → display:
    - Avg. completion rate
    - Most failed quiz/module
    - Suggested content tweaks

---

### 🧑‍💼 Admin Dashboard – Nura AI Section

Add analytics & insight cards:

- **Predictive Learning Trends**
  - Chart: Trending skill tags
  - List: Recommended new course areas
- **Bias & Equity Monitor**
  - Equity graph (e.g., bar chart of pass rates by group)
  - Text summary of flagged concerns
- **Generate System Report**
  - Button: “Generate Report”
  - Output: Summary of most active departments, course gaps, compliance %

---

### 📦 UI/UX Guidelines

- Use clean, card-based layout with tabs or accordions for sections
- Use Tailwind for consistency:
  - Cards (`rounded-lg`, `shadow`, `bg-white`, `p-4`)
  - Buttons (`bg-indigo-600`, `text-white`, `hover:bg-indigo-700`)
- Mobile-friendly grid for responsive layouts
- Icons: Use Heroicons (if available) for status and feedback
- Allow props to control visibility by role (`userRole` prop)

---

### 🧪 Bonus (Optional)

- Use mock JSON responses for now (simulate AI output)
- Each action button (e.g., “Generate Report”) should:
  - Simulate loading state
  - Display dummy output in a `<pre>` or result box

---

Let’s start by building:
- `components/NuraAISection.js`
- `pages/learner/NuraAI.js`
- `pages/mentor/NuraAI.js`
- `pages/admin/NuraAI.js`

Once done, I’ll integrate with the backend or AI service later.
